<div hidden>
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of 
the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow 
sun. 

Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an 
utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life 
forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches 
are a pretty neat idea. 

This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most 
of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many 
solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were 
largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, 
which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of 
paper that were unhappy. 

And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and 
most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. 

Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big 
mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some 
said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should 
ever have left the oceans. 

And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man 
had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice 
to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in 
Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going 
wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be 
made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, 
and no one would have to get nailed to anything. 

Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone 
about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost 
forever. 

This is not her story. 



But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its 
consequences. 

It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide 
to the Galaxy - not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until 
the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any 
Earthman. 

Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book. 

In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out 
of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman 
had ever heard either. 

Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful 
one - more popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better 
selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more 
controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical 
blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest 
Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway? 

In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim 
of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted the 
great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all 
knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and 
contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it 
scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important 
respects. 

First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words DON'T 
PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover. 

But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its 
extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these 
consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book 
begins very simply. 

It begins with a house.
